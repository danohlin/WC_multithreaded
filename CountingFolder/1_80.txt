Hurricane Katrina wa one of the greatet catatrophe to hit the United State  Nearly 1600 died in Louiiana alone with maive flooding in New Orlean when it levee failed  The torm diplaced about 300000 people and caued over $80 billion in damage  While a natural diater wa initially blamed for the damage it i now evident that our government had ignificant reponibility

In a cathing deciion US Ditrict Court Judge Stanwood Duval Jr placed ignificant blame for the damage to New Orlean during the Hurricane quarely in the lap of the Army Corp of Engineer  Judge Duval found that

¡°It i the court¡¯ opinion that the negligence of the Corp in thi intance by failing to maintain the MRGO Miiippi River Gulf Outlet properly wa not policy but inouciance myopia and hortightedne¡±

¡°For over 40 year the Corp wa aware that the Reach II levee protecting Chalmette and the Lower Ninth Ward wa going to be compromied by the continued deterioration of the MRGO ¡­ The Corp had an opportunity to take a myriad of action to alleviate thi deterioration or rehabilitate thi deterioration and failed to do o  Clearly the expreion ¡®talk i cheap¡¯ applie here¡±

¡°Thi court cannot but comment that the Corp¡¯ approach remind the court of the old adage ¡®Cloe your eye and you become inviible¡¯¡±

¡°It i beyond arbitrary and capriciou ¡ª it flie in the face of the purpoe of NEPA the National Environmental Policy Act and ignore the very heart of what ¡®operation¡¯ mean¡±

Referring to the Corp¡¯ action ¡°were in direct contravention of profeional engineering and afety tandard¡± ¡­¡­ ¡°¡­ Ignoring afety and poor engineering are not policy and clearly the Corp engaged in uch activitie¡±

According to Duval the MRGO channel that wa managed by the Army Corp of Engineer wa not properly maintained  A a reult it widened with eroion and deteriorated making the wall vulnerable to wave from Lake Borgne  Thi led to levee failure and ubequent flooding of portion of New Orlean

The Court¡¯ ruling wa in favor of a half dozen plaintiff whoe property wa damaged by Katrina  While the damage amounted only to about $700000 there were 100000 home and buinee in the affected parih and Lower 9th Ward  Judge Duval¡¯ ruling will lead to compenation for many more  So firt taxpayer pay to build the levee and maintain them and now we get to pay for the incompetence of our government  Look for a multibillion dollar bill added to our already ballooning deficit

If government caued catatrophe like Katrina were iolated it could be paed off a a bad mitake  However it i not  Government have a hitory of creating ¡°mitake¡± that are very expenive  Whether it i contruction project uch a Katrina cientificytem failure a in the pace huttle Challenger diater wrongly predicting oncoming event uch a Y2K or not properly managing agencie uch a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the government¡¯ track record i very poor

Given the recent letdown of the private ector uch a the Wall Street bank ome American look to government for the cure  If hitory i the judge it indicate that the cure i often wore than the dieae
